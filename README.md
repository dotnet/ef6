Core# Entity Framework 6.x

Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

Entity Framework is actively developed by the Entity Framework team in collaboration with a community of open source developers. Together we are dedicated to creating the best possible data access experience for .NET developers.

## EF6.x here, EF Core elsewhere

This project is for Entity Framework 6.x. Entity Framework Core is a lightweight and extensible version of Entity Framework and is maintained at https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore.

## How do I use EF

If you want to use an officially supported Entity Framework release to develop your applications then head to https://msdn.com/data/ef where you can find installation information, documentation, tutorials, samples, and videos.

If you want to try out the latest changes that have not been officially released yet, [signed nightly builds](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework6/wiki/Nightly-Builds) of the Entity Framework code base are made available

## How do I contribute

There are lots of ways to [contribute to the Entity Framework project](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework6/wiki/Contributing) including testing out nighty builds, reporting bugs, and contributing code.

All code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the Entity Framework team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.
